  "note": "When you attach an APS-C-compatible lens and set [ Shooting] to [Off], you may not achieve optimal shooting results. For example, the edges of the image may become darker. When [ Shooting] is set to [On], the angle of view is the same as when shooting with an APS-C-size image sensor. [ Shooting] is locked to [Off] when shooting movies in 4K 60p/50p or 8K. We recommend using a lens compatible with the 35 mm full-frame format. When shooting movies in 4K 60p/50p or 8K, the angle of view becomes approximately 1.2 times the focal length indicated on the lens."
