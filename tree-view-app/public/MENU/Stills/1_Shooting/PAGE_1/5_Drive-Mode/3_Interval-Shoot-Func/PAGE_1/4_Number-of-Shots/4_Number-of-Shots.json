  "note": "You may not be able to record the set number of images depending on the remaining battery level and the amount of free space on the recording medium. Supply power via USB while shooting, and use a memory card with sufficient space.
When the shooting interval is short, the camera may get hot easily. Depending on the ambient temperature, you may not be able to record the set number of images because the camera may stop recording to protect the equipment."
